### A simple Tic-Tac-Toe for terminal written in C/C++.

To build, run:

	make
	
To build and run, you can execute:

	make run
	
To clean outputs builds files, run:

	make clean
	
To run the build binary, run:
	
	./tttoe

#### Note:
-The game have a bug in the player input. The out lines in terminal are duplicated. I have no idea of the cause.
